# BasedJack: The Nounish Way to Play Blackjack on Farcaster!

"BasedJack: The Ultimate Nounish Blackjack Experience on Farcaster!"

## Introduction

BasedJack is a classic blackjack game with a unique nounish theme inspired by the Nouns DAO NFT project. Playable directly within the Farcaster and Warpcast apps, BasedJack combines fun gameplay with competitive elements, making it the ultimate nounish blackjack experience.

## The Problem It Solves

1. **Lack of Engaging Games on Farcaster**: Users of Farcaster and Warpcast lacked access to engaging and fun games that could be played directly within the apps.
2. **Desire for Themed Gaming Experiences**: There was a demand for games with unique and vibrant themes. BasedJack meets this demand by incorporating the nounish theme of the Nouns DAO NFT project.
3. **Need for Competitive Elements**: Players wanted more than just gameplay; they sought competitive elements to enhance their experience. BasedJack solves this by providing a comprehensive leaderboard tracking win streaks, win percentage, rank, top 3 players, and total games played.
4. **In-App Gaming**: Users can enjoy BasedJack without needing to leave the Farcaster or Warpcast platforms, enhancing user convenience and engagement.
5. **Minting of Achievements on Base**: Planned integration for minting achievements on **Base** blockchain will incentivize users and contribute to the growth and adoption of the **base** blockchain.
6. **Promoting Nouns DAO**: By using and promoting the nounish theme, BasedJack helps increase the visibility and growth of Nouns NFTs and the overall Nouns ecosystem.

## Challenges We Ran Into

1. **Enabling Gaming on Farcaster Frames**: Implementing a nounish gaming experience within Farcaster frames was challenging. We had to develop solutions to allow smooth gameplay within the app, akin to playing games on meta tags.
2. **Managing Database and Frames**: Efficiently managing the game data and frames on Farcaster was another hurdle. Ensuring real-time updates and synchronization between the game and the leaderboard required a robust database management system.
3. **Creating API and Game Logic**: Designing and implementing the API for BasedJack and coding the game logic posed both fun and challenging aspects of development. It involved crafting efficient algorithms and ensuring smooth gameplay mechanics.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Utilized for building the frontend of the application, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.
- **MongoDB**: Employed as the database to store game data, leaderboard statistics, and player information. Its scalability and flexibility were crucial in managing the dynamic data requirements of the game.
- **Onchain Kit**: Used to obtain frames data for seamless integration and interaction within Farcaster's environment. [Learn more about Onchain Kit](https://onchainkit.xyz/).
